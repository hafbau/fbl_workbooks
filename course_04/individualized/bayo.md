- Has schedule, to be posting
- Javascripting not on GitHub yet (To do it in this session)
- Feels conditionals are clear
  - If can write up a pseudocode plan, he's able to utilize the right conditional
- Comfortable with function syntaxes as long as logic is straight forward
  - `const someFunc = function () {}`
  - `function someFunc() {}`
  - Yet to practice arrow functions: `() => {}`
